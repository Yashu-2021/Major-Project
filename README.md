# 🌍 **Impact of Climate Change and Land Degradation on Global Food Production**  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This major project dives deep into understanding the intricate relationships between **land degradation**, **climate change**, and **global food production**. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the **World Bank** covering **100 countries** and **7 key indicators**, we’ve developed predictive models to analyze and forecast the impact of these factors on agricultural productivity.  

### 🔍 **Key Highlights**  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - **DecisionTreeRegressor**: Demonstrated superior accuracy in forecasting food production trends.  
   - **ARIMA**: Used for time series predictions of environmental and agricultural variables.  
- **Data Imputation & Model Evaluation**: Enhanced prediction accuracy by addressing missing values and evaluating model performance rigorously.  
- **Insights**:  
   - Highlighted critical environmental challenges affecting food security.  
   - Provided actionable insights for developing **resilient agricultural policies** and **adaptive strategies**.  

## 📊 **Interactive Visualization with Streamlit**  
To make the results accessible and intuitive, we developed a **Streamlit app** that allows users to:  
- Input desired parameters to predict agricultural outcomes.  
- Visualize predictions with **interactive graphs and plots** for better interpretation and decision-making.  

## 🌱 **Why It Matters**  
This project underscores the importance of tackling **environmental challenges** like climate change and land degradation to secure global food systems. By promoting **data-driven transparency** and **innovative planning**, the findings aim to inspire sustainable solutions for policymakers, researchers, and agricultural planners.
